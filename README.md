  * * Author: Hugh D. Young
   
  * For more than five decades, Sears and Zemansky's College Physics has provided the most reliable foundation of physics education for students around the world. The Ninth Edition continues that tradition with new features that directly address the demands on today’s student and today’s classroom.
 
  * A broad and thorough introduction to physics, this new edition maintains its highly respected, traditional approach while implementing some new solutions to student difficulties. Many ideas stemming from educational research help students develop greater confidence in solving problems, deepen conceptual understanding, and strengthen quantitative-reasoning skills, while helping them connect what they learn with their other courses and the changing world around them. Math review has been expanded to encompass a full chapter, complete with end-of-chapter questions, and in each chapter biomedical applications and problems have been added along with a set of MCAT-style passage problems. Media resources have been strengthened and linked to the Pearson eText, MasteringPhysics®, and much more.
